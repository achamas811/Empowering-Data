# Empowering-Data

### Instructions
To run this program, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
 - pandas
   - pip install pandas
 - Matplotlib
   - pip instal matplotlib
   
In addition, be sure to run this program in the command prompt rather than using the Microsoft Visual Studio Code run button as this will cause the input() function built into Python to malfunction. 

Hope you enjoy my program!
