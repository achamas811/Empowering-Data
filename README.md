# Empowering-Data-Project

### Instructions
To run this program, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
 - pandas
   - pip install pandas
 - Matplotlib
   - pip install matplotlib
   
In addition, be sure to run this program in the command prompt rather than using the Microsoft Visual Studio Code run button as this will cause the input() function built into Python to malfunction. 

To run in the command prompt, type the following: python EmpoweringData.py

Disclaimer: these commands are for Windows. For Mac and Linux devices, use pip3 instead of pip and python3 instead of python!

Hope you enjoy my program!
